**Introduction**

In recent years, the Australian government has undertaken a pivotal decision to adapt gas stations across the country, driven by a strategic focus on enhancing infrastructure to meet evolving needs and environmental goals. This adaptation not only reflects a proactive stance towards sustainable energy but also aims to optimize the convenience and efficiency of fuel distribution nationwide.

To ensure the success of these adapted gas stations, comprehensive data analytics have been employed to analyze traffic patterns and consumption trends. This data-driven approach enables the government and stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding location, operational hours, and service offerings. However, the collection and analysis of such data present various challenges that must be navigated to derive meaningful insights and drive effective policy-making.

This case study delves into the methodologies and outcomes of leveraging data analytics in optimizing the placement and operations of adapted gas stations in Australia. By examining traffic patterns and consumer behaviors, it aims to uncover the critical factors influencing the success and sustainability of this initiative.

To retrieve the songs of a specific artist, you'll need to perform multiple queries:

1. Find the albums by the artist using their `artistId`.
2. Find the songs for those albums using the `albumId`s.

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to accomplish this:

1. **Ensure you have the necessary packages installed**:
   - `mongodb`: MongoDB driver for Node.js.

   You can install it using npm if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

2. **Create a connection to your MongoDB database**:
   - Connect to your MongoDB instance.
   - Access the appropriate database and collections.

3. **Write queries to retrieve albums and then songs for the specified artist**.

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function getSongsByArtist(artistId) {
  const uri = 'your_mongodb_connection_string'; // Replace with your MongoDB connection string
  const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const database = client.db('your_database_name'); // Replace with your database name
    const albumsCollection = database.collection('albums');
    const songsCollection = database.collection('songs');

    // Step 1: Find albums by the artist
    const albums = await albumsCollection.find({ artistid: artistId }).toArray();
    const albumIds = albums.map(album => album._id);

    if (albumIds.length === 0) {
      console.log('No albums found for artist:', artistId);
      return [];
    }

    // Step 2: Find songs by albumIds
    const songs = await songsCollection.find({ albumid: { $in: albumIds } }).toArray();

    console.log('Songs for artist:', artistId);
    console.log(songs);
    return songs;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return [];
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

// Example usage:
const artistId = 'specific_artist_id'; // Replace with the actual artist ID
getSongsByArtist(artistId);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Connection String**:
   - Replace `'your_mongodb_connection_string'` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

2. **Database and Collection Names**:
   - Replace `'your_database_name'` with the name of your database.
   - The collection names are assumed to be `albums` and `songs`.

3. **Step 1 - Finding Albums by Artist**:
   - The `albumsCollection.find({ artistid: artistId }).toArray()` query fetches all albums for the specified artist.
   - `albumIds` extracts the `_id` fields of these albums.

4. **Step 2 - Finding Songs by Album IDs**:
   - The `songsCollection.find({ albumid: { $in: albumIds } }).toArray()` query fetches all songs that belong to the albums retrieved in the previous step.

5. **Example Usage**:
   - Replace `'specific_artist_id'` with the actual artist ID you want to search for.

Make sure your MongoDB server is running and accessible from your Node.js application. This script will connect to the database, fetch songs for the specified artist, and print them to the console. Adjust the connection string, database name, and artist ID as per your requirements.To retrieve the songs of a specific artist, you'll need to perform multiple queries:
